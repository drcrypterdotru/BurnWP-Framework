## 📌 Introduction

We are proud to announce the release of **BurnWP Framework v1.0.0** — a powerful WordPress auto-exploitation tool built with a custom plugin for practical and effective penetration testing.

Unlike traditional vulnerability scanners that only detect potential issues, **BurnWP Framework** is designed to actively exploit known WordPress CVEs and gain shell access when possible.  
This makes it a valuable tool for security professionals who need results, not just reports.  
Version 1.0.0 focuses exclusively on WordPress vulnerabilities and is optimized for Windows users, offering a simple user interface for configuration and execution.  
This is just the beginning—expect more CMS support and advanced modules in future versions.

## 🚀 Features – BurnWP Framework v1.0.0

BurnWP Framework is designed for offensive security professionals who want more than just scanning—it provides real-world exploitation capabilities, a modular plugin system, and an intuitive user interface.

### ✅ 1. Mass Exploitation Using `Target_Lists.txt`

Run exploitation against multiple targets listed in `Target_Lists.txt` (one URL per line).

> **INFO:**  
> To fully utilize the framework, enable the following in `ui_config`:
> - CVE Exploiter  
> - LFI Scanner  
> - Plugin Exploiter  

When combined, these modules provide powerful exploitation capabilities across multiple attack vectors.

### ✅ 2. Single Plugin with Bulk Targets

Select a specific plugin from `Plugin_Lists` and test it against a list of targets in `Lists.txt`.

> **Use Case:** Ideal for testing your favorite plugin against multiple websites (e.g., your own domains or local environments).

---

### ✅ 3. Single Plugin with Single Target

Test one specific plugin exploit against a single target domain.

> **Use Case:** 1-to-1 plugin testing — great for precision testing or local development.

### 🛠️ 4. Developer Mode – Build Your Own Plugins

Create and drop your own custom exploit plugins into the `Plugins_Exploiter/` directory.  
Simply run BurnWP using `install_plugin`, and your plugin will be:

- ✅ Loaded in real time  
- ✅ Validated for structure and errors  
- ✅ Debugged live with error notifications  

> **INFO:**
> - Supports WordPress CVEs and any other CVE-based web application exploits, including PHP, Laravel, etc.  
> - Use the `Plugin_BurnWP()` function as the entry point, similar to a `main()` function.  
> - Supports both GET and POST methods via prebuilt `Shell_Loader` forms.  
> - A full tutorial will be provided in future releases.
